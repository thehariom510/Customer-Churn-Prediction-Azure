# Azure-Based Customer Churn Prediction
A data science project to predict customer churn using Azure Machine Learning Studio, Azure Blob Storage, and Python. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and deployment.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (not tracked in Git).
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model development.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Files to ignore in version control.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up an Azure account and configure Azure Machine Learning Studio.

## Dataset
The dataset (`churn.csv`) includes customer attributes like age, subscription length, monthly bill, and churn status (1 for churned, 0 for retained).
